## Join Us - An Email Collecting Website
This is a practice project when learning SQL. This web page is built for collecting user emails using Node and SQL.
Below is the web screenshot after finished.

Project, including code and database, is built on Could 9, which is quite simple to use with preview function. It simplifies the set up of SQL server and supports live viewing of what is built. Of course there is no problem of transfering to a local or online SQL server.

This is a very useful and good SQL course. Start from easy then go deeper, with a simple but rewarding project on the end.
